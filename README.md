## ScholarlyTrends - Trendy Research Topics

### What is ScholarlyTrends?

**ScholarlyTrends** uncovers trendy research directions by exploring citation data associated with publications.

### Motivation

Google Scholar is an indispensable tool when I'm stalking professors for grad school. Having spent some time poking around different profiles, I have observed a few interesting things:
* Some researchers' publications have seen exponential growth of citations. Of course this is highly correlated with renewed and galvanized interests in their areas. To see what areas show this kind of behaviour would be a fun thing to do.
* Maybe predict what areas will bloom?
* See the rise and fall in research interest and understand why this happens ðŸ˜Ž (As a self-claimed student of history, this  really exhilarates me) 

### Goals
Explore the citation data and see what models them the best.
Find relationship between trends and topics.
Have more fun by "stalking" people systematically and scholarly.

### Resources
The following may be of help when retrieving data:
* [Scholarly](https://pypi.org/project/scholarly/) python package for Google Scholar data retrieval
* [scholar.py](https://github.com/ckreibich/scholar.py) another python library for GS :)
